# Using the web interface

To start our web UI, simply run

```bash
./start_web_ui.sh
```

from the root of the repository.

!!! tip "Opening the webpage"
    If the user interface doesn't automatically open in your browser, please open it at `http://localhost:3000`. 
    Running from GitHub codespaces? More tips [here](../installation/codespaces.md#running-the-web-ui).

!!! warning "Limitations"
    Currently, the web interface only has a subset of the options of the command line interface (CLI).
