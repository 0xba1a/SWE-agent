      replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text
      in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only
      end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make
      sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked
      for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error,
      the edit will not be executed.
