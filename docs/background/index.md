## SWE-agent <a name="swe-agent"></a>

SWE-agent turns LMs (e.g. GPT-4) into software engineering agents that can fix issues in GitHub repositories.

On [SWE-bench](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench), SWE-agent resolves **12.29%** of issues, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on the full test set.

We accomplish our results by designing simple LM-centric commands and feedback formats to make it easier for the LM to browse the repository, view, edit and execute code files. We call this an ðŸ¤– **Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)**.
Read more about the ACI [here](aci.md).

SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University.

## <span class="enigma">EnIGMA</span> <a name="enigma"></a>

<span class="enigma">EnIGMA</span> (Enhanced Interactive Generative Model Agent) is an LM agent built on top of SWE-agent for solving Capture The Flag (CTF) cybersecurity challenges.

On [NYU CTF benchmark](https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database), EnIGMA solves **13.5%** of challenges, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on the full test set of 200 CTF challenges (leaderboard), **surpassing previous agents by more than 3x** ([leaderboard](https://enigma-agent.github.io/#leaderboard)).

We accomplish our results by extending the [ðŸ¤– ACIs](../background/aci.md) first introduced in SWE-agent, to the cybersecurity domain. We establish the novel [**:gear: Interactive Agent Tools** (IATs)](iat.md) concept, which enables our agent to use interactive tools such as a debugger, in a multiprocess way such that the agent still has access to the main shell.

We also use a new **Summarizer** concept integrated into the agent to deal with long context. Read more about our different summarizers [here](../config/summarizers.md).

Specific [demonstrations](../config/demonstrations.md) were built per each CTF category (cryptography, reverse-engineering, forensics, ...), to enhance the model ability to solve new tasks from the same category.

EnIGMA is built and maintained by researchers from Tel-Aviv University, New York University and Princeton University.
