  edit:
    signature: |
      edit <search> <replace> [<replace-all>]
    docstring: >
      Replace first occurrence of <search> with <replace> in the currently displayed lines.
      If --replace-all is specified, replace all occurrences of <search> with <replace>.

      For example, if you are looking at this file:

      def fct():
          print("Hello world")

      and you want to edit the file to read:

      def fct():
          print("Hello")
          print("world")

      you search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `"Hello"\n    print("world")`
      (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).

      You could also get the same result by search for `    print("Hello world")` and replace with `    print("Hello")\n    print("world")`.

      Tips:

      1. Always include proper whitespace and indentation
      2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings!
      3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.
