# Installation from source

Installation from source is the preferred way to set up SWE-agent on your machine.

1. Clone the repository, for example with
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent.git
    ```
2. Run
    ```
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --editable .
    ```
    at the repository root (as with any python setup, it's recommended to use [conda][] or [virtual environments][] to manage dependencies).
3. Set up your language model of choice as explained [here](keys.md).

**Optional:**

1. The default backend for SWE-agent is docker, so we recommend to install Docker
   ([follow the docs](https://github.com/docker/docker-install) or use the [get-docker.sh script for linux](https://github.com/docker/docker-install)),
   then start Docker locally. Problems? See [docker issues](tips.md#docker).
   If you do not want to use docker, you can still use SWE-agent with code evaluation in the cloud.
2. If you plan on using the web-based GUI: Install [`nodejs`][nodejs-install].

!!! tip "Docker issues"
    If you run into docker issues, see the [installation tips section](tips.md) for more help.

!!! tip "Updating"
    SWE-agent is still in active development. Features and enhancement are added often.
    To make sure you are on the latest version, periodically run `git pull`
    (there is no need to redo the `pip install`).

!!! note "Development setup"
